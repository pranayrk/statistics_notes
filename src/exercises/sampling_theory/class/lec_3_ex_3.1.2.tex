\begin{ex}
Color blindness appears in 1\%  of the people in a certain population. How large must a sample be if the probability of its containing a color-blind person is to be 0.95 or more? (Assume that the population is large enough to be considered infinite, so that sampling can be considered to be with replacement.)
\end{ex}
\begin{ans}
Sample size greater than 299
\end{ans}
