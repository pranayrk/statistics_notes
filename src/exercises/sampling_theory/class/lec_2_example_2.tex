\begin{ex}
Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be a random sample of $n$ identical circuit boards whose times until failure are thought to follow an exponential($\beta$) population. Find the joint distribution of the sample. What is the probability that all the boards last more than 2 years?
\end{ex}
\begin{ans}
$f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)  = f(x_1) f(x_2) ... f(x_n) = \Pi_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\beta} \exp(\frac{-x_i}{\beta})$ \\
$P(X_1 > 2, X_2 > 2, ..., X_n > 2) = \exp(\frac{-2n}{\beta})$
\end{ans}
